This repository is the home of my personal knowledge management (PKM) system, also known as a "Digital Garden." It is a living collection of my notes, tutorials, project logs, and references.

### The Philosophy

The purpose of this library is to document my learning journey in public. While my main [professional portfolio](https://arenjay-ventures.github.io) is a curated "museum" of my best work, this library is my "workshop"â€”a place for exploration, experimentation, and sharing knowledge.

Content here is in various states of completion and is continuously updated as I learn and build.

### Content Overview

This library is organized into several key sections:

*   **Templates:** Reusable templates for project reports, vulnerability assessments, and more.
*   **References:** A collection of cheatsheets, links to tools, and notes on key technologies like Git, Linux, and AWS.
*   **Tutorials:** Step-by-step guides I've written to document processes I've learned.
*   **Project Logs:** Detailed, in-progress logs and notes from my various hands-on projects.
