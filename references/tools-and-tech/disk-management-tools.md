# Disk Management and System Tools

## **TOOLS**

### **balenaEtcher**
**Bootable USB** balenaEtcher is very easy to use step-by-step guided UI for setting up a bootable ISO file on a USB. 

This is my method for creating bootable linux, and linux install tools.

### **WinDirStat **
**Disk Manager** WinDirStat is a disk usage and statistics viewer and cleanup assistant for MS clients and servers.
When consolidating hard drive content and preparing drives for my media server I needed a way to more completely view the large folders and files. Determining content and proper location was a chore. 

### **BitLocker **
**Disk Manager** Full Harddisk encryption built into Windows OS.
Easy to use to get full hard disk encryption with no additional tools.




### **CoreTemp**
**CoreTemp** No frills temperature monitoring during heavy use. Install, it works.
