# Project Report Template

This template is designed to structure a project summary for quick reading by a potential employer, hiring manager, or technical lead. It focuses on demonstrating problem-solving, technical implementation, and outcomes.

---

### **Project Title:**
*   (A clear, descriptive name for the project)

### **1. Executive Summary**
*   **(1-2 sentences)** A high-level pitch of the project. What was the core problem and what was the result?
*   **Technologies Used:** `List`, `Of`, `Key`, `Technologies`, `Like`, `Python`, `AWS S3`, `Docker`, `Wazuh`
*   **Project Link:** `[Live Demo](http://example.com)` or `[GitHub Repo](http://github.com/link)`

---

### **2. The Problem & Objective**
*   **(1 paragraph)** Describe the scenario or challenge you were trying to address. What was the goal? Why was this project necessary or interesting?
*   *Example: "Standard home routers lack visibility into network threats. My objective was to build a low-cost, centralized security monitoring system for my home lab using open-source tools to detect and analyze potential intrusions in real-time."*

---

### **3. The Implementation & Process**
*   **(Bulleted list or short paragraphs)** Detail the key steps you took to build the solution. This is where you showcase your technical process. Focus on the "how" and "why" of your decisions.
*   *Example Step 1: **Infrastructure Setup.** Deployed three Ubuntu Server VMs in VirtualBox, configured with a host-only network to simulate an isolated corporate environment.*
*   *Example Step 2: **SIEM Installation.** Installed and configured a Wazuh server on the primary monitoring VM, ensuring agent communication ports were correctly firewalled.*
*   *Example Step 3: **Log Ingestion & Testing.** Deployed Wazuh agents to the target VMs. Generated test traffic using Nmap from a Kali Linux VM to verify that logs were being collected and that basic intrusion detection rules were firing correctly.*

---

### **4. Challenges & Resolutions**
*   **(1-2 bullet points)** This is a critical section. Describe a specific technical hurdle you faced and how you overcame it. This demonstrates troubleshooting and resilience.
*   *Example Challenge: **Log Parsing Failure.** Initially, logs from my custom web application were not being parsed correctly by Wazuh. The default decoders did not recognize the log format.*
*   *Example Resolution: **Custom Decoder Development.** I researched the Wazuh XML decoder syntax and wrote a custom decoder and rule set to correctly identify and categorize the specific event types from my application logs, which I then tested and deployed to the server.*

---

### **5. Outcome & Results**
*   **(1 paragraph)** What was the final result? Was the objective met? What did you learn?
*   *Example: "The project was successful. The SIEM now provides real-time visibility into the lab network, successfully detecting and alerting on reconnaissance scans, brute-force attempts, and specific web application attacks. This project significantly deepened my understanding of log management, SIEM architecture, and the importance of custom detection rules."*
