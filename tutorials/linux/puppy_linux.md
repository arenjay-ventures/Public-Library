## Introduction: Why Puppy Linux?

Puppy Linux is not just another Linux distribution—it's a philosophy. Designed to run entirely in RAM, it's incredibly fast, requires minimal resources, and can revive old hardware that other operating systems have left behind. Today, you'll learn why Puppy is the perfect introduction to Linux fundamentals and system efficiency.

**What Makes Puppy Unique:**
- Runs completely in RAM (typically uses 300-500MB)
- Boots in 30-60 seconds even on ancient hardware
- Can run from CD/DVD/USB without hard drive
- Includes everything needed for daily computing in ~400MB
- Perfect for understanding Linux basics without bloat
- Saves state on shutdown (preserving your changes)

**Today's Learning Goals:**
- Master Puppy's unique save file system
- Understand RAM-based computing advantages
- Navigate the lightweight desktop environment
- Learn essential Linux commands in a forgiving environment
- Configure and customize a minimal system
- Rescue and recover data from other systems

**Time Required:** 6-8 hours (with breaks)

---

## Morning Session (8:00 AM - 12:00 PM)

### Hour 1: First Boot and Initial Setup (8:00 - 9:00 AM)

#### Boot Puppy Linux
1. Select Puppy Linux from Ventoy menu
2. Choose boot option: "puppy (First boot)" or similar
3. Wait for desktop to load (notice the speed!)

**What's Happening Behind the Scenes:**
- Puppy is decompressing itself into RAM
- The entire operating system fits in memory
- Your hard drive isn't being touched yet
- This is why it's so fast—everything runs from RAM

#### Initial Configuration Wizard

**Step 1: Keyboard Layout**
- Select your keyboard layout (typically US English)
- Test it by typing in the text field
- **Why this matters:** Linux uses different keyboard mappings; setting this correctly prevents frustration

**Step 2: Time Zone Setup**
- Select your geographic location
- Choose your specific time zone
- **Why this matters:** Affects file timestamps, system logs, and scheduled tasks

**Step 3: Desktop Resolution**
- Puppy will attempt auto-detection
- Adjust if needed through the wizard
- **Why this matters:** Running at native resolution improves clarity and performance

#### Understanding the Desktop Environment

**Take 15 minutes to explore:**

**The Desktop Layout:**
- Desktop icons (typically: drive icons, home, trash)
- Taskbar at bottom (or top, depending on Puppy version)
- System tray with network, volume, battery indicators
- Menu button (usually bottom-left)

**Key Desktop Icons:**
- **home** - Your personal files directory
- **tmp** - Temporary files (cleared on reboot)
- Drive icons (sda1, sdb1, etc.) - Your computer's storage devices

**The Puppy Menu System:**
- Click the menu button (may be labeled "Menu" or show Puppy logo)
- Notice the organization: Desktop, System, Utilities, Filesystem, etc.
- **This is different from Windows/Mac:** Linux organizes by function, not application name

**Exercise 1: Desktop Familiarization (15 minutes)**

1. Right-click on desktop → observe context menu
2. Click each drive icon → notice they "mount" when clicked
3. Open "home" → this is your personal space
4. Open "tmp" → understand temporary storage
5. Explore menu categories without launching programs yet

**Why This Matters:**
Puppy's interface is intentionally simple. Understanding this layout teaches you fundamental Linux concepts (mounting, home directories, file hierarchies) without overwhelming complexity.

---

### Hour 2: The Save File System (9:00 - 10:00 AM)

This is Puppy's most important and unique feature. Master this, and you understand what makes Puppy special.

#### Understanding Puppy's Persistence Model

**The Concept:**
- Puppy runs entirely in RAM (volatile memory)
- When you shutdown, RAM is erased
- A "save file" preserves your changes between sessions
- This save file can be on USB, hard drive, or other media

**Why This Design?**
- **Speed:** RAM is 100x faster than even SSD storage
- **Safety:** Your actual disk isn't being constantly written to
- **Flexibility:** Can run from read-only media (CD/DVD)
- **Recovery:** Easy to start fresh if something breaks

#### Creating Your First Save File

**You'll be prompted on first shutdown, but let's understand the options now:**

1. **Access the Save File Creator:**
   - Menu → System → Puppy Event Manager
   - Or wait until shutdown (it will prompt automatically)

2. **Choose Save File Location:**
   - Your USB drive (recommended for portability)
   - Internal hard drive (if you have one)
   - External drive

3. **Select Save File Type:**
   - **Normal save file** - Single file containing all changes (recommended)
   - **Save folder** - Directory with your changes (faster but less portable)
   - **Multisession CD/DVD** - For optical media (not applicable here)

4. **Set Save File Size:**
   - Minimum: 512MB (adequate for basic use)
   - Recommended: 2048MB (2GB) for comfortable use
   - Maximum: Depends on available space
   - **Our recommendation:** 2GB to start

**Exercise 2: Save File Strategy (20 minutes)**

Let's test the save system:

1. **Create a test file:**
   - Open the file manager (desktop → "home" icon)
   - Right-click in empty space → Create New → Text file
   - Name it "day1_test.txt"
   - Double-click to open, type: "Testing Puppy save system"
   - Save and close

2. **Change desktop appearance:**
   - Right-click desktop → Desktop → Set desktop background
   - Choose a different wallpaper
   - Apply changes

3. **Install a program:**
   - Menu → Setup → Puppy Package Manager
   - Search for "htop" (system monitor)
   - Click "htop" in results
   - Click "Do it" to install
   - Close package manager

4. **Make a system change:**
   - Menu → Desktop → Set default applications
   - Look around (don't change anything critical yet)
   - Close

**Now, let's save and reboot:**

1. Menu → Shutdown → Reboot
2. Choose "Save to file" when prompted
3. Select location: Your USB drive
4. Name: "puppysave" (or similar)
5. Size: 2048MB
6. Click "OK" and wait for creation
7. Allow system to reboot

**After Reboot - Verify Persistence:**
- Is your test file still in home directory?
- Is the wallpaper the same?
- Check if htop installed: Menu → System → Htop
- **All should be preserved!**

**Understanding What Happened:**
- During shutdown, Puppy copied changed files from RAM to save file
- Save file was stored on your USB drive
- On reboot, Puppy loaded base system + your save file
- All customizations restored from save file

**Why This Is Powerful:**
- Your base system stays clean and pristine
- Can delete save file anytime to start fresh
- Multiple save files = multiple "profiles"
- Corrupt save file? Boot fresh and create new one

---

### Hour 3: File System Navigation and Management (10:00 - 11:00 AM)

Now that you understand persistence, let's explore Puppy's file system.

#### Understanding Linux File Hierarchy

**The Root Directory (/):**
Unlike Windows (C:\, D:\), Linux has one root: /

**Key Directories You'll Use:**

1. **/root** - Your home directory (confusing name, but you're the "root" user in Puppy)
2. **/tmp** - Temporary files (cleared on reboot)
3. **/mnt** - Where drives "mount" (become accessible)
4. **/usr** - User programs and applications
5. **/etc** - System configuration files
6. **/opt** - Optional/additional software

**Exercise 3: File System Explorer (30 minutes)**

**Part A: ROX-Filer Basics**

Puppy uses ROX-Filer as its file manager. Let's master it:

1. **Open ROX-Filer:**
   - Click "home" icon on desktop
   - Or Menu → Filesystem → Root directory (to see everything)

2. **Navigation Techniques:**
   - Single-click folders to open
   - Back button to go up one level
   - Path bar at top shows current location
   - Click path components to jump to that location

3. **View Modes:**
   - Menu bar → Display → Large Icons
   - Menu bar → Display → Small Icons  
   - Menu bar → Display → List View
   - **Try each:** Notice information displayed

4. **Showing Hidden Files:**
   - Menu bar → Display → Show Hidden
   - Notice files starting with "." appear
   - **Why hidden?** Usually configuration files you rarely need

**Part B: File Operations Practice**

Create a practice directory structure:

1. **In home directory (/root):**
   - Right-click empty space → New Directory
   - Name it "linux_practice"
   - Enter the directory

2. **Create subdirectories:**
   - Create: "documents", "scripts", "downloads", "temp"
   - This mimics a typical user directory structure

3. **Create sample files:**
   - In documents: Right-click → Create → Text file → "notes.txt"
   - In scripts: Create "test.sh"
   - Practice creating several files

4. **File Operations:**
   - **Copy:** Right-click file → Copy, navigate elsewhere, right-click → Paste
   - **Move:** Drag and drop between folders
   - **Rename:** Right-click → Rename
   - **Delete:** Right-click → Delete (goes to trash)
   - **Trash location:** /root/.trash

5. **Multiple Selection:**
   - Hold Ctrl and click files to select multiple
   - Right-click any selected file for batch operations

**Part C: Understanding Permissions**

This is crucial Linux knowledge:

1. **Right-click any file → Properties**
2. **Notice Permissions tab:**
   - Owner: Who owns the file (you're "root")
   - Group: Group ownership
   - Others: Everyone else

3. **Permission Types:**
   - **Read (r):** Can view file contents
   - **Write (w):** Can modify file
   - **Execute (x):** Can run as program

4. **Understanding the Display:**
   - Example: "rwxr-xr-x"
   - First three: Owner permissions (rwx = read, write, execute)
   - Second three: Group permissions (r-x = read, execute only)
   - Last three: Other permissions (r-x = read, execute only)

**Exercise: Make a Script Executable**

1. In your "scripts" folder, create "hello.sh"
2. Open it in a text editor
3. Type:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "Hello from Puppy Linux!"
   ```
4. Save and close
5. Right-click → Properties → Permissions
6. Check "Execute" boxes
7. Double-click the file → Choose "Execute in Terminal"
8. See your message!

**Why This Matters:**
Linux security is based on permissions. Understanding this now prevents confusion later when scripts won't run or files won't open.

**Take a real break!** Step away from the computer.

**Reflection Questions While Eating:**
- How does Puppy's speed compare to your regular OS?
- What surprised you about the save file system?
- Which applications seem most useful?
- What feels different from Windows/Mac?

---

## Afternoon Session (1:00 PM - 5:00 PM)

### Hour 5: Command Line Fundamentals (1:00 - 2:00 PM)

The terminal is where Linux's true power lives. Puppy is the perfect place to learn because mistakes are easily fixed.

#### Opening the Terminal

**Multiple Ways:**
- Desktop → Terminal icon (if present)
- Menu → Utility → Terminal
- Right-click desktop → Window → Terminal here

**What You See:**
```
root@puppypc:~#
```

**Breaking This Down:**
- **root:** Your username (Puppy logs you in as administrator)
- **@puppypc:** Your computer name
- **~:** Current directory (~ means home directory)
- **#:** Prompt symbol (# means root/admin, $ means regular user)

#### Essential Commands - Part 1: Navigation

**Command: pwd (Print Working Directory)**
```bash
pwd
```
- **Shows:** Your current location in file system
- **Example output:** /root
- **Why useful:** Know where you are before acting

**Command: ls (List)**
```bash
ls
```
- **Shows:** Files and directories in current location
- **Common options:**
  - `ls -l` - Long format (shows permissions, size, date)
  - `ls -a` - Show all (including hidden files)
  - `ls -lh` - Human-readable sizes (KB, MB, GB)
  - `ls -lt` - Sort by modification time

**Try It:**
```bash
ls
ls -l
ls -lh
ls -a
ls -lah
```
- **Notice:** Different information displayed
- **Hidden files:** Start with "."

**Command: cd (Change Directory)**
```bash
cd /usr
pwd
ls
```
- **Result:** You're now in /usr directory
- **Return home:** `cd` or `cd ~`
- **Go up one level:** `cd ..`
- **Go to root:** `cd /`

**Exercise 7: Navigate Your File System (15 minutes)**

Complete this navigation challenge:

```bash
# Start at home
cd ~
pwd

# Go to your practice directory
cd linux_practice
pwd
ls

# Go into documents
cd documents
ls

# Go up one level
cd ..
pwd

# Go to system directory
cd /etc
ls
# Notice system configuration files

# Return home
cd ~
pwd
```

**Pro Tips:**
- **Tab completion:** Type `cd doc` then press Tab - it completes to `documents`
- **Previous directory:** `cd -` returns to last location
- **Path shortcuts:** 
  - `~` = home directory
  - `.` = current directory
  - `..` = parent directory

#### Essential Commands - Part 2: File Operations

**Command: cat (Concatenate/Display File)**
```bash
cat notes.txt
```
- **Shows:** Entire file contents in terminal
- **Use case:** Quick viewing of small files

**Command: less (Page Through File)**
```bash
less notes.txt
```
- **Shows:** One page at a time
- **Controls:**
  - Space: Next page
  - b: Previous page
  - /search_term: Search in file
  - q: Quit
- **Use case:** Reading longer files

**Command: cp (Copy)**
```bash
cp source.txt destination.txt
cp file.txt /tmp/
```
- **Syntax:** `cp source destination`
- **Copy directory:** `cp -r folder_name /tmp/`
  - `-r` means recursive (include contents)

**Command: mv (Move/Rename)**
```bash
mv oldname.txt newname.txt
mv file.txt /tmp/
```
- **Dual purpose:** Rename OR move
- **No separate rename command** in Linux

**Command: rm (Remove)**
```bash
rm file.txt
rm -r folder_name
```
- **WARNING:** No trash bin, deletion is permanent!
- **Use with caution**
- **For directories:** Must use `-r` flag

**Exercise 8: File Manipulation Practice (20 minutes)**

Create and manipulate files from terminal:

```bash
# Go to practice area
cd ~/linux_practice/temp

# Create empty files
touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
ls

# Add content to file
echo "This is a test" > file1.txt
cat file1.txt

# Append more content
echo "Second line" >> file1.txt
cat file1.txt

# Copy file
cp file1.txt file1_backup.txt
ls

# Rename file
mv file2.txt file2_renamed.txt
ls

# Create directory
mkdir test_folder
ls

# Copy file into directory
cp file1.txt test_folder/
ls test_folder/

# Remove file
rm file3.txt
ls

# Try to remove directory
rm test_folder
# Error! Directory not empty

# Remove directory and contents
rm -r test_folder
ls
```

**Understanding Operators:**
- `>` - Redirect output to file (overwrites)
- `>>` - Append output to file
- `|` - Pipe output to another command

#### System Information Commands

**Command: free (Memory Usage)**
```bash
free -h
```
- **Shows:** RAM and swap usage
- `-h` = human readable format
- **Notice:** How much is used? (Should be minimal in Puppy!)

**Command: df (Disk Free)**
```bash
df -h
```
- **Shows:** Disk space on all mounted drives
- See your save file size

**Command: uname (System Information)**
```bash
uname -a
```
- **Shows:** Kernel version, architecture, hostname

**Command: ps (Process Status)**
```bash
ps aux
```
- **Shows:** All running processes
- **Columns:**
  - PID: Process ID number
  - %CPU: CPU usage
  - %MEM: Memory usage
  - COMMAND: Program name

**Better Process Viewer:**
```bash
htop
```
- Remember we installed this earlier?
- **Interactive display** of processes
- Arrow keys to navigate
- F9 to kill process
- q to quit

**Exercise 9: System Documentation (15 minutes)**

Gather system information:

```bash
# Create a system info file
cd ~/documents

# Add hostname
echo "System: $(hostname)" > system_info.txt

# Add kernel version
echo "Kernel: $(uname -r)" >> system_info.txt

# Add memory info
echo "Memory:" >> system_info.txt
free -h >> system_info.txt

# Add disk info  
echo "Disk Space:" >> system_info.txt
df -h >> system_info.txt

# View your report
cat system_info.txt
```

**What You Learned:**
- `$()` runs command and uses output
- Creating reports from command line
- Gathering system diagnostics

1. **Multiple Sound Systems:**
   - Right-click volume icon
   - Choose sound system (ALSA, PulseAudio, etc.)

2. **Test audio:**
   - Menu → Multimedia → Audio mixer
   - Play test sound
   - Adjust levels

**Exercise 13: System Optimization (20 minutes)**

Configure Puppy for optimal performance:

**1. Startup Speed:**
- Menu → System → BootManager
- Review boot options
- Disable unused services
- **Be conservative** - only disable if you understand the service

**2. Memory Management:**
- Menu → System → Pmem (Puppy Memory Monitor)
- Observe what's using RAM
- Close unnecessary programs

**3. Swap Configuration:**
```bash
# Check if swap is enabled
free -h

# If you need swap (unlikely in Puppy):
# Menu → System → GParted → Create swap partition
```

**4. Create Efficiency Scripts:**

Create a cleanup script:

```bash
cd ~/scripts
nano cleanup.sh
```

Add this content:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Cleanup script for Puppy Linux

echo "Starting cleanup..."

# Clear thumbnail cache
rm -rf ~/.thumbnails/*

# Clear trash
rm -rf ~/.trash/*

# Clear temp files
rm -rf /tmp/*

# Clear browser cache (adjust path for your browser)
rm -rf ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default/cache/*

echo "Cleanup complete!"
```

Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x cleanup.sh
```

Run it:
```bash
./cleanup.sh
```

**Create a backup script:**

```bash
nano backup.sh
```

Add:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Backup important files

BACKUP_DIR="/mnt/home/puppy_backups"
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d)

mkdir -p $BACKUP_DIR

# Backup documents
tar -czf $BACKUP_DIR/documents_$DATE.tar.gz ~/documents/

# Backup scripts
tar -czf $BACKUP_DIR/scripts_$DATE.tar.gz ~/scripts/

echo "Backup complete: $BACKUP_DIR"
```

Make executable:
```bash
chmod +x backup.sh
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Automation saves time
- Regular maintenance prevents issues
- Scripts are reusable across Linux systems

### Hour 8: Advanced Topics and Real-World Use Cases (4:00 - 5:00 PM)

Now that you understand Puppy, let's explore practical applications.

#### Use Case 1: System Recovery and Data Rescue

Puppy excels at rescuing data from broken systems.

**Scenario:** Your main computer won't boot. How can Puppy help?

**Exercise 14: Data Rescue Simulation (20 minutes)**

1. **Boot Puppy** (you're already here)

2. **Mount the "broken" drive:**
   - Click drive icons on desktop
   - They mount to /mnt/
   - Example: /mnt/sda1

3. **Navigate to data:**
   ```bash
   cd /mnt/sda1/
   ls
   # You'd see the other OS's file structure
   ```

4. **Copy important files:**
   ```bash
   # Copy to USB drive
   cp -r /mnt/sda1/Users/YourName/Documents /mnt/sdb1/rescue/
   
   # Or create compressed backup
   cd /mnt/sda1/Users/YourName/
   tar -czf /mnt/sdb1/documents_backup.tar.gz Documents/
   ```

5. **Verify the copy:**
   ```bash
   ls -lh /mnt/sdb1/rescue/
   # Check file sizes match
   ```

**Real-World Recovery Techniques:**

- **Photo recovery:** Use TestDisk (install from package manager)
- **Partition recovery:** GParted (Menu → System → GParted)
- **Password reset:** Use chroot to access other Linux systems
- **Windows data access:** Puppy can read NTFS partitions

**Exercise 15: Create a Rescue USB Toolkit (15 minutes)**

Make Puppy your go-to rescue system:

1. **Install recovery tools:**
   ```bash
   # From Package Manager:
   # - testdisk (file recovery)
   # - gparted (partition editor)
   # - ddrescue (disk cloning)
   ```

2. **Create a rescue scripts folder:**
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/rescue_scripts
   cd ~/rescue_scripts
   ```

3. **Create a mount helper script:**
   ```bash
   nano mount_all.sh
   ```
   
   Add:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # Mount all available partitions
   
   echo "Mounting all partitions..."
   
   for partition in /dev/sd[a-z][1-9]; do
       if [ -b "$partition" ]; then
           mount_point="/mnt/$(basename $partition)"
           mkdir -p $mount_point
           mount $partition $mount_point 2>/dev/null
           if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
               echo "Mounted $partition to $mount_point"
           fi
       fi
   done
   
   echo "Done! Check /mnt/ for mounted drives"
   ```
   
   Make executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x mount_all.sh
   ```

4. **Create a data finder script:**
   ```bash
   nano find_documents.sh
   ```
   
   Add:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # Find common document locations
   
   echo "Searching for documents..."
   
   find /mnt -type f \( -name "*.pdf" -o -name "*.doc*" -o -name "*.xls*" -o -name "*.ppt*" \) 2>/dev/null | head -20
   
   echo ""
   echo "Searching for photos..."
   find /mnt -type f \( -name "*.jpg" -o -name "*.jpeg" -o -name "*.png" \) 2>/dev/null | head -20
   ```
   
   Make executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x find_documents.sh
   ```

**Why This Use Case Matters:**
- Puppy can boot when other systems fail
- Access data from any OS (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- Small size means fast deployment
- No installation required - just boot and rescue

---

#### Use Case 2: Portable Computing Environment

**Scenario:** You need a consistent computing environment across multiple computers.

**Exercise 16: Configure Portable Workspace (15 minutes)**

1. **Essential portable applications:**
   - Web browser with bookmark sync
   - Text editor with your configurations
   - SSH client for remote access
   - Cloud storage sync tools

2. **Create portable config backup:**
   ```bash
   cd ~
   mkdir portable_configs
   
   # Copy important configs
   cp .bashrc portable_configs/
   cp -r .config portable_configs/
   cp -r scripts portable_configs/
   
   # Create restore script
   nano portable_configs/restore.sh
   ```
   
   Add:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # Restore portable configurations
   
   cp portable_configs/.bashrc ~/
   cp -r portable_configs/.config ~/
   cp -r portable_configs/scripts ~/
   
   echo "Configurations restored!"
   ```

3. **Sync your save file:**
   - Keep your Puppy save file on USB
   - Boot any computer with same environment
   - All settings and files travel with you

**Benefits:**
- Same desktop on any computer
- Your tools always available
- Privacy - no traces left on host computer
- Educational - learn on different hardware

---

#### Use Case 3: Testing and Learning Environment

**Scenario:** Learn Linux without risking your main system.

**Exercise 17: Safe Experimentation Zone (10 minutes)**

1. **Create experimental save files:**
   ```bash
   # Can have multiple save files for different purposes:
   # - puppysave_learning.2fs (for tutorials)
   # - puppysave_coding.2fs (for development)
   # - puppysave_rescue.2fs (for recovery tools)
   ```

2. **Practice "dangerous" commands safely:**
   ```bash
   # These are safe in Puppy because of RAM operation:
   
   # Explore system files
   cd /etc
   cat /etc/passwd  # User database
   cat /etc/fstab   # File system table
   
   # Modify configs (only affects RAM until saved)
   nano /etc/hosts  # Network hosts file
   
   # If you break something?
   # Just reboot without saving!
   ```

3. **Learn scripting without fear:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/scripts
   nano experiment.sh
   ```
   
   Try various commands:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   
   # Loop example
   for i in {1..5}; do
       echo "Count: $i"
   done
   
   # Conditional example
   if [ -f "test.txt" ]; then
       echo "File exists"
   else
       echo "File not found"
       touch test.txt
   fi
   
   # Function example
   greet() {
       echo "Hello, $1!"
   }
   
   greet "Puppy Linux User"
   ```

**Learning Advantages:**
- Mistakes don't persist (unless you save)
- Fast reboots for fresh starts
- Understand system internals hands-on
- Build confidence with Linux
