# Sudo Apt Install Opsec

This project list is for software and basic tools for operational security.
---
### **hidden files exposed:**
*   Some System files are hidden and not immediately viewable to the user. These steps will expose those files for further review.

**WINDOWS**

STEPS TO COMPLETE: 
1: Open File Explorer
2: In the Ellipses menu
3: Click on Options
4: Then click on View tab
5: In the advanced Settings menu UNCHECK the “Hide protected operating system files”
6: Click Yes, Apply, OK
*DONE*
---
### **pagefile.sys and swapfile.sys**
*   This file can get very large and is indicative of the computer using a lot of virtual memory. My file was not ridiculously large, but we will check its settings anyways. I recently doubled the available RAM and may be able to adjust the max settings down.

STEPS TO COMPLETE: Disable automatic management:
1: Open File Explorer, right-click This PC, select Properties, then Advanced System Settings.
2: Go to the Advanced Tab, click Settings under Performance, and then select the Advanced tab again
3: Under Virtual Memory, click Change, then uncheck Automatically manage page file size for all drives.
4: Select your drive, choose Custom Size, and enter manual size.
Won’t Take Effect until after Reboot.

There is an option to not use a paging file. This is not recommended in general user settings.

**may want to disable for less caching of activities, this may effect performance and even cause issues**

### **BitLocker Check:**
*   **BitLocker** BitLocker is full hard disk encryption native to Windows. It requires a Recovery Key, and therefore is often OFF when shipped with a new computer. It must be turned on and a recovery key created by the new user.

I checked on a computer that came with Windows pre-installed and determined BitLocker had never been set up…so these are the steps to set it up.

STEPS TO CHECK AND SET UP:
1: In windows search, type Manage BitLocker (select it)
2: In the BitLocker Drive Encryption page, you can see which drive volumes have BitLocker on or not.
3: Select the Drive you want to Encrypt
4: Create you recovery key, either save the file, print the key, etc (**KEEP SAFE NEVER LOSE**
5: Select whether you want to Encrypt used disk space only (for a new computer or drive) OR Encrypt entire drive
6: Select Encryption mode (explanation is provided)
7: Select “Run BitLocker system check” (we don’t want a small issue to make us lose access to EVERYTHING)
8: Computer will Restart
9: log back in: computer may appear normal, opening BitLocker again it will not say “BitLocker Encrypting” This may take a while if a large drive.


### **hiberfil.sys:**
*   When consolidating hard drive data I came across the VERY large file of hiberfil.sys. This file holds a snapshot of the RAM image for hibernating the computer and allowing a faster start up from where the user left off. This file is NOT encrypted  unless using system drive level encryption such as BitLocker is enabled.

If we are not using the hibernate feature (I don’t) it is a unneeded waste of space for the very large file.
If we are not using BitLocker on the system drive of the computer, then it is susceptible to extraction from a physical attack.
We can turn it off and it will automatically delete the file as well. I may turn it back on after hard drives are cleaned up and BitLocker installed.

STEPS TO COMPLETE: 
1: Open Windows PowerShell as an Administrator
2: Type the command 
	powercfg /h off

and press Enter

3: Hibernation will be turned off and the hiberfil.sys file will be automatically deleted.
### **BitLocker To Go:** TODO FINISH THIS
*   **BitLocker** BitLocker To Go Provide USB level encyption

STEPS TO CHECK AND SET UP:
1: In windows search, type Manage BitLocker (select it)
2: In the BitLocker Drive Encryption page, you can see which drive volumes have BitLocker on or not, you can insert a USB Drive
3: Select the USB Drive you want to Encrypt
4: Create you recovery key, either save the file, print the key, etc (**KEEP SAFE NEVER LOSE**
5: Select whether you want to Encrypt used disk space only (for a new computer or drive) OR Encrypt entire drive
6: Select Encryption mode (explanation is provided)
7: Select “Run BitLocker system check” (we don’t want a small issue to make us lose access to EVERYTHING)
8: Computer will Restart
9: log back in: computer may appear normal, opening BitLocker again it will not say “BitLocker Encrypting” This may take a while if a large drive.

### **1. Executive Summary**
*   **(1-2 sentences)** A high-level pitch of the project. What was the core problem and what was the result?
*   **Technologies Used:** `List`, `Of`, `Key`, `Technologies`, `Like`, `Python`, `AWS S3`, `Docker`, `Wazuh`
*   **Project Link:** `[Live Demo](http://example.com)` or `[GitHub Repo](http://github.com/link)`

---

### **2. The Problem & Objective**
*   **(1 paragraph)** Describe the scenario or challenge you were trying to address. What was the goal? Why was this project necessary or interesting?
*   *Example: "Standard home routers lack visibility into network threats. My objective was to build a low-cost, centralized security monitoring system for my home lab using open-source tools to detect and analyze potential intrusions in real-time."*

---

### **3. The Implementation & Process**
*   **(Bulleted list or short paragraphs)** Detail the key steps you took to build the solution. This is where you showcase your technical process. Focus on the "how" and "why" of your decisions.
*   *Example Step 1: **Infrastructure Setup.** Deployed three Ubuntu Server VMs in VirtualBox, configured with a host-only network to simulate an isolated corporate environment.*
*   *Example Step 2: **SIEM Installation.** Installed and configured a Wazuh server on the primary monitoring VM, ensuring agent communication ports were correctly firewalled.*
*   *Example Step 3: **Log Ingestion & Testing.** Deployed Wazuh agents to the target VMs. Generated test traffic using Nmap from a Kali Linux VM to verify that logs were being collected and that basic intrusion detection rules were firing correctly.*

---

### **4. Challenges & Resolutions**
*   **(1-2 bullet points)** This is a critical section. Describe a specific technical hurdle you faced and how you overcame it. This demonstrates troubleshooting and resilience.
*   *Example Challenge: **Log Parsing Failure.** Initially, logs from my custom web application were not being parsed correctly by Wazuh. The default decoders did not recognize the log format.*
*   *Example Resolution: **Custom Decoder Development.** I researched the Wazuh XML decoder syntax and wrote a custom decoder and rule set to correctly identify and categorize the specific event types from my application logs, which I then tested and deployed to the server.*

---

### **5. Outcome & Results**
*   **(1 paragraph)** What was the final result? Was the objective met? What did you learn?
*   *Example: "The project was successful. The SIEM now provides real-time visibility into the lab network, successfully detecting and alerting on reconnaissance scans, brute-force attempts, and specific web application attacks. This project significantly deepened my understanding of log management, SIEM architecture, and the importance of custom detection rules."*
